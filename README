SharpSource


Description:
SharpSource is a SourceMod extension which enables the developer to create native pawn functions with C# and access SourceMod functionality from within C#.


Dependencies:
In order to run SharpSource you need to have Mono installed on your machine aswell as the developer files for mono.
A small all-in-one version will be shipped aswell later.
If you are using linux just use a package management tool like apt to install all the dependencies (gmcs-dev, mono-dev, mono).


How to install:
go to the sourcemodplugin directory and write: make
1. Compile the sourcemodplugin for your engine and place it the extensions subdir of sourcemod: <game>/addons/sourcemod/extensions/
1. a) Compiling on Linux.
      Just enter the command in the sourcemodplugin directory: make ENGINE=orangebox
      If it doesn't work, set the Makefile directory definitions properly.
      The binary will show up in Release.orangebox, it will be called sharpsource.ext.so, place it in sourcemod/extensions/
2. Create an empty file called sharpsource.autoload in the extensions directory.
3. Compile the C# code in the SharpSource/ directory, use MonoDevelop or the xbuild command and place the compiled SharpSource.dll in srcds/orangebox/ where srcds is the path to your source dedicated server.
4. Run the server, for now it will just print "C#: Hello World".
